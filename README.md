# grimdor

Grimdor is a chat and music bot for discord. It is written in python.

The latest version of python can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Grimdor uses the discord.py framework. It can be installed by following this tutorial https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing

The install tools (namely pip and venv) should come preinstalled with python.

The bot login token is not uploaded to the git. Lol.

This code will probably collect dust in a hole until the end of time, but that is ok.
